# Online_Covid_Vaccination
This is a Web application which is use to booking the covid vaccination center in online.

# Tech stack
In this system, I used HTML, CSS, and JS for frontend development, and PHP for Backend development, along with the MYSQL database.

# How to install 
Download and extract the Online_Covid_Vaccination.zip file into your server's PHP directory. (In xampp, extract the zip in this path "c:\xampp\htdocs").

Then create the database and run the query stored in this folder "Online_Covid_Vaccination/Database/Covid_Vaccine.sql".

Finally, configure the database connection variables such as servername, username, password, and database name in the config.php file, which is stored in this folder "Online_Covid_Vaccination/config.php".
